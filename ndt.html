          <h2>Positive Material Identification (PMI)</h2>
          <p>
            Positive Material Identification is often among the first non-destructive testing methods that companies ask about.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recognize that your site managers and safety officers need to verify that all the elements on their site are made from the appropriate material. Gain the assurance you need that you are managing your assets correctly through our PMI services.
          </p>
          
    
          <h4>What does Positive Material Identification (PMI) mean?</h4>
          <p>
            PMI is a technique for identifying the different elements of a particular substance. Typically, it is used to determine the exact components of metal alloys. This facilitates a better comprehension of the asset's advantages and disadvantages.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is portable, enabling us to offer this service both onsite and within the organization. Two methods for identifying materials include the X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyzer and Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES).
          </p>
    
          <h4>What is PMI used to detect?</h4>
          <p>
            This method is employed across different sectors and can be vital for maintaining components and complying with safety standards.

          <h4>What does Magnetic Particle Inspection involve?</h4>
          <p>
            Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) is employed to detect surface defects in ferromagnetic (magnetic) materials. A magnetic field is generated inside the component, utilizing a magnetic powder that contains particles. The magnetic flux penetrates any defects and attracts the particles, highlighting any shortcomings.
          </p>
    
          <h4>What is MPI utilized for detection?</h4>
          <p>
            MPI is usually used to detect defects on surfaces, such as toe cracks and crater cracks. It also allows for the identification of areas with porosity. It is a simple, portable method suitable for castings, shafts, and welds. It delivers quick results and can detect imperfections up to 2mm below the surface.
          </p>
          <h4>What constraints does MPI face?</h4>
          <p>
            This method requires surfaces to be clean before testing begins. It might also require a power source and uses combustible liquids, which could render it unsuitable for certain areas on site. MPI cannot be used on non-ferromagnetic materials.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Dye Penetrant Inspection (DPI) service aims to detect surface-breaking defects by using a dye to highlight cracks, which are then examined under various lighting conditions. This method is quick and cost-effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, DPI is used on non-ferromagnetic materials—substances that do not exhibit magnetism and do not contain iron. While our technicians sometimes use this method for ferromagnetic materials, they generally prefer magnetic particle inspection in such cases.
          </p>
    
          <h4>What is DPI utilized for identification?</h4>
          <p>
            DPI is frequently employed to assess shafts, castings, welds, and minor machined components. This straightforward and convenient method is effective in detecting surface defects and surface porosity. Additionally, it is used to identify cracks and crater-like breaks.
          </p>
          
          <h4>What restrictions does DPI possess?</h4>
          <p>
            This non-invasive testing method can only detect flaws that penetrate the surface and requires a clean surface before inspection. Moreover, it relies on temperature, making it unsuitable for cold environments.

          <h4>What does Eddy Current Inspection entail?</h4>
          <p>
            Eddy Current Testing (EC) uses electromagnetic concepts to detect surface flaws. Flaws cause changes in the conductivity of the material, allowing the probe to identify problematic areas. This is a portable technique appropriate for coated surfaces, and advanced EC systems can provide enduring records of inspection data. The technique yields prompt results, needing little surface preparation.
          </p>
    
          <h4>What is EC utilized to identify?</h4>
          <p>
            EC is used to detect pitting, surface fatigue fractures, and stress corrosion cracks in tubes and pipes.

          <h4>What does Ultrasonic Examination refer to?</h4>
          <p>
            Ultrasonic Testing (UT) utilizes ultrasonic waves to identify internal defects in various materials. It applies to most materials.
          </p>
    
          <h4>What is Ultrasonic Testing used to detect?</h4>
          <p>
            UT is capable of detecting corrosion, thinning, and internal flat defects. It also identifies cracks and gaps and is useful for analyzing pressure vessels, storage tanks, and welds in high-pressure environments. This method is advantageous for analyzing forgings, castings, and welds in structural steel.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can evaluate thickness by examining the paint on the surface. It can thoroughly penetrate substances and deliver instant outcomes, allowing for rapid report creation.
          </p>
          
          <h4>What constraints does UT face?</h4>
          <p>
            UT exclusively detects flaws in a material and is often employed alongside surface examination techniques such as Magnetic Particle Inspection. When assessing welds, a minimum material thickness may be required. Furthermore, surface dirt can influence the quality of the outcome, and unevenly shaped components can as well, indicating that the method may not be suitable for all assets. Additionally, the one-way characteristic of the probe's beam requires the probe to be moved manually to cover all parts.
